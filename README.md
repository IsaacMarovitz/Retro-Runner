# Retro Runner Backup
Hi. This is a backup for a game. Nothing very exciting. If you're looking for builds of the game, go to [this](https://github.com/IsaacMarovitz/Builds_Retro-Runner) like here to try it out! Feel free to download my code. It was built for Unity 2018.3.2f1, and should work fine in basicaly any Unity 2018 version.
